# project-Program Description
This is a Naive Bayes Email Spam Classifier - a machine learning-based web application that automatically detects whether an email is spam or legitimate (ham). Here's what it does:
Core Functionality:

Input: Users paste email content into a text area
Processing: Uses Naive Bayes algorithm to analyze word patterns
Output: Classifies email as SPAM ðŸš¨ or HAM (Legitimate) âœ… with confidence percentages

Key Features:

Machine Learning Algorithm:

Implements Naive Bayes classification with Laplace smoothing
Pre-trained on 20 examples (10 spam, 10 legitimate emails)
Uses word frequency analysis and probability calculations


Interactive Interface:

Modern gradient design with responsive layout
Real-time classification with visual probability bars
Statistics tracking (total emails processed, spam/ham counts)
98.2% claimed model accuracy


Training Data Visibility:

Shows example spam emails: "WIN FREE MONEY NOW!", "URGENT: Account suspended!"
Shows legitimate examples: "Hi John, let's meet for coffee", "Please review the quarterly report"



How It Works:

Tokenization: Breaks email text into individual words
Probability Calculation: Compares word frequencies between spam and ham training data
Bayes Theorem: Calculates likelihood of spam vs. legitimate classification
Confidence Scoring: Shows percentage confidence in the classification

Sample Output:

Classification: "SPAM" or "HAM (Legitimate)" with emoji indicators
Confidence Level: E.g., "Confidence: 94.3%"
Probability Breakdown: Visual bars showing spam vs. ham percentages
Statistics: Running count of classified emails

Use Cases:

Email security training
Educational demonstration of machine learning
Basic spam filtering prototype
Understanding Naive Bayes algorithm in practice

This program effectively demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to email security, making it accessible through a user-friendly web interface while showing the mathematical foundations behind the classification decisions.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
